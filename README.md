This project aims to analyze sales data from the customer sales_data_sample table to gain insights into product sales, customer behavior, and revenue trends.

## What is RFM ? 

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a method used to analyze and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. It involves the following key components:

- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer has made a purchase. It is calculated as the number of days since the customer's last purchase.

- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes a purchase. It is calculated as the total number of purchases made by the customer over a certain period.

- **Monetary Value (M)**: How much money a customer has spent. It is calculated as the total monetary value of all purchases made by the customer over a certain period.

RFM analysis helps businesses identify different customer segments, such as:

- **Loyal Customers**: High Frequency, High Monetary Value, and recent purchases.
- **Potential Churners**: High Frequency and Monetary Value but not purchased recently.
- **New Customers**: Recent first purchase.
- **Lost Customers**: Low Frequency, Low Monetary Value, and not purchased recently.

By segmenting customers based on RFM, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each customer segment and improve overall customer satisfaction and retention.
